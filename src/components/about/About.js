          My name is Michael Koohang, and I'm an incoming software engineer at Nike.
          My background is in Human-Computer Interaction and Software Engineering, and I
          build mobile and full-stack applications, mainly in iOS and React.

          I'm an engineer by trade and a designer at heart. I love using the technologies
          around me to improve people's lives, and I enjoy teaching computer science to others
          while making my own personal apps. I also love playing soccer, running, and exercising every 
          chance I get. My obsessions include music, movies, and my work.
