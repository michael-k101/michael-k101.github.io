This was especially important to me given the myriad of mechanisms that iPhones have in place to protect your data that you may never even notice while using it. So, I decided to create a simple puzzle game that involved solving 3 privacy-focused challenges, each related to a certain aspect of the iPhone that protect's people's privacy. The goal was to have a little fun while simultaneously giving a light introduction and/or reminder to how the iPhone protects users' privacy.",
