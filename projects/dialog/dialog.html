        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Dia/Log takes your privacy seriously and will uphold the highest standards to protect it. By using our app,
            you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
        <p>Great news. Dia/Log doesn't collect any of your data outside of the application. All the data you
            log on the application stays on your iPhone. It is never sent over the internet or provided to
            third parties. It's your data, and we intend to keep it that way.
        </p>

        <h3>Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
        <p>We do not require that you log in to the app with an email or password, so none of your data is tracked.
            Everything you log within Dia/Log stays within the app. Period.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Do With the Information</h3>
        <p>As stated before, the data you log within Dia/Log stays within Dia/Log and never leaves your iPhone.
            The data itself is displayed only through the app itself in the form of lists and graphs. You are free
            to add, delete, and change your data at will. If you delete the app, all of your data is deleted along with
            it.
        </p>

        <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in app features. Users are bound by
            any
            changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the app after such changes have been first
            posted.</p>

        <h3>Questions or Concerns</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy, please send us a detailed message to
            michael.s.k1001@gmail.com.
            We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
