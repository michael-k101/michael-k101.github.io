            My name is Michael Koohang and I'm an incoming software engineer at Nike.
            My background is in Human-Computer Interaction and Software Engineering, and I
            build mobile and full-stack applications, mainly in iOS and React.

            I'm an engineer by trade and a designer at heart. I love using the technologies
            around me to improve people's lives, and I see it as an obligation to do so with
            the computing and design skills I've acquired in my studies. I also love playing 
            soccer and running and exercising every chance I get. My obsessions include music, 
            Harry Potter, and my work (of course).
